					I couldn't make this word any longer. Here's an overview over out templates :)

							<h2>Standard Post</h2>
							<p>
								Template for everything that hasn't a template. Use this for the post after a (fantasy) tournament or after a training camp or everything else. If you use it for the post after a non-fantasy tournament, you can put score posts behind this in the post!

						<div class="article-content">
							<h2>Score Post</h2>
							<p>
								Template to post the result of a game after a game. Please don't make a post for a single group stage game! You either put all results in a single post with multiple pictures or just put the result in the story after a game.

						<div class="article-content">
							<h2>Schedule Post</h2>
							<p>
								Template to announce league gamedays and other events with a schedule (e.g. tournament group stages). If there are more than five games scheduled, split the schedule on multiple pictures, which should be posted in a single post. You can leave out games without one of our teams too! But please don't use this template to announce a single game (e.g. a knockout stage game)! You can use the announcement template instead!

						<div class="article-content">
							<h2>Announcement Post</h2>
							<p>
								Template for all kinds of announcements. Whenever there are great news or just normal news to spread, use this template, e.g. when we're about play a game in knockout stage. If you use this template to post about a game (e.g. to say that we're playing the quarter finals vs Team X at Y o'clock in the livestream), please use this as announcement only (prior to game) and use the score template for results. Also please don't announce group stage games :)
